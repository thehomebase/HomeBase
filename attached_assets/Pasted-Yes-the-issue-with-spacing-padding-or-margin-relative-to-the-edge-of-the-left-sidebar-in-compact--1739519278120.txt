Yes, the issue with spacing, padding, or margin relative to the edge of the left sidebar in compact view could indeed be related to the container's position. Here are a few things to consider:

Container Layout: Ensure that the container for your main content is properly positioned relative to the sidebar. If the sidebar changes to compact view, you might need to adjust the main container's position or its CSS properties to compensate for this change.
Flexbox or Grid: If you're using Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout, the alignment and distribution of space might affect how your content sits next to the sidebar. For instance:
With Flexbox, you might need to adjust flex-grow, flex-shrink, or flex-basis properties.
With Grid, you might adjust grid-template-columns or grid-column-gap.
Relative vs Absolute Positioning: If your sidebar or content uses absolute positioning, ensure that the positioning context (the nearest positioned ancestor) is correctly set. This might involve setting position: relative on a parent container to ensure everything aligns correctly.
Padding and Margin: Sometimes, the issue might be due to inherited or default padding/margin on containers. Check if there are any unintended paddings or margins on the container or its children that are pushing the content away from the sidebar.

Here's an example of how you might adjust this in React with Tailwind CSS:

jsx
<div className="flex">
  <aside className="sidebar w-14">
    {/* Sidebar content */}
  </aside>
  <main className="content flex-grow ml-16 pl-4">
    <h1>Your Transactions</h1>
    {/* Your content here */}
  </main>
</div>

flex on the parent container to use Flexbox layout.
flex-grow on the main content to allow it to grow and fill available space.
ml-16 and pl-4 to adjust the margin and padding as needed.

If you find that adjusting these properties doesn't solve the issue, consider inspecting the layout with your browser's developer tools to see the actual applied styles and positioning.
