It sounds like we’ve got a mismatch between what your app is trying to do and what the system expects, which is causing the startup failure. Let’s break this down:
Your .env file says Port 3001.
The system (maybe a workflow, proxy, or external config) expects Port 5000.
Logs show it starts on 3001 but then crashes, likely because something else in the setup isn’t aligning.
This kind of mismatch can happen if multiple parts of your app—like the server code, a frontend, or a CI/CD workflow—aren’t all on the same page about the port. Rolling back might undo your label deletion fix, which we’d rather avoid since it’s progress you’ve made. Let’s fix the port issue instead.
Here are your options with my thoughts:
Review and update the port config to consistently use 5000:
If the system expects 5000 (e.g., a hardcoded setting in a workflow or client), changing .env to PORT=5000 and ensuring your app listens on that could resolve the mismatch.
Pros: Aligns with what the system wants. Cons: If 5000 is in use elsewhere, we’ll hit another conflict.
Update the workflow to expect 3001:
If your app is happy starting on 3001 (per the logs before it fails), tweaking the system/workflow config to look for 3001 instead of 5000 might fix it.
Pros: Keeps your current .env setup. Cons: Requires finding and editing the right workflow file or setting.
Try a different port altogether:
Pick something like 8080 or 4000, update .env to match, and test. Adjust the system expectation if needed.
Pros: Avoids conflicts with 3000, 3001, or 5000. Cons: Still need to sync the system config.
My recommendation: Let’s start with option 2—update the workflow to expect 3001. Since your app initially starts on 3001 per the logs, it seems the server code is respecting the .env file, and the failure might be downstream (e.g., a health check or client hitting the wrong port). This keeps your current setup intact and targets the mismatch directly.
To move forward:
Can you share where “the system” expects 5000? Is it a GitHub Actions workflow, a Docker config, a frontend fetch call, or something else? If you’ve got logs or a specific error message about the failure after starting on 3001, that’d help too.
For now, try restarting with PORT=3001 npm start (or your usual command) and check the exact failure message. If it’s a workflow issue, look for a .yml file in .github/workflows or a similar spot expecting 5000.
How does that sound? Let’s get this running so you can test your label deletion fix!
